distribution function) model is developed that includes mutual shadowing
by waves, wave facet hiding, and projection weighting. The integral form
of the model is reduced to an analytical form by making minor and
justifiable approximations. The new form of the BRDF thus allows one to
compute sea reflected radiance more than 100 times faster than the
traditional numerical solutions. The repercussions of the approximations
used in the model are discussed. Using the analytical form of the BRDF,
an analytical approximation is also obtained for the reflected sun
radiance that is always good to within 1\% of the numerical solution for
sun elevations of more than 10{\^A}{\deg} above the horizon. The model
is validated against measured sea radiances found in the literature and
is shown to be in very good agreement.

Under the assumption that the surface height is statistically

be reduced to a single integration involving the marginal density
function for the slopes in the plane of incidence. From this general
result is is immediately obvious that for backscatter the shadowing
function is unity at normal incidence and zero at grazing incidence. The
backscattering shadowing function is computed for an exponential slope
density and compared to the Gaussian case.

State-of-the-art car paint shows not only interesting and subtle angular dependency but also significant spatial variation. Especially in sunlight these variations remain visible even for distances up to a few meters and give the coating a strong impression of depth which cannot be reproduced by a single BRDF model and the kind of procedural noise textures typically used. Instead of explicitly modeling the responsible effect particles we propose to use image-based reflectance measurements of real paint samples and represent their spatial varying part by Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF). We use classical BRDF models like Cook-Torrance to represent the reflection behavior of the base paint and the highly specular finish and demonstrate how the parameters of these models can be derived from the BTF measurements. For rendering, the image-based spatially varying part is compressed and efficiently synthesized. This paper introduces the first hybrid analytical and image-based representation for car paint and enables the photo-realistic rendering of all significant effects of highly complex coatings.

The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features :  simplicity (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation insures adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).

  abstract  = {This paper presents a BRDF model based on the analysis of the photon collisions with the microfacets of the  surface. The new model is not only physically plausible, i.e. symmetric and energy conserving, but provides other  important features of real materials, including the off-specular peak and the mirroring limit case. Using theoretical  considerations the reflected light is broken down to a specular component representing single reflections and a  matte component accounting for multiple reflections and re-emissions of previously absorbed photons. Unlike most  of the previous models, the proportion of the matte and specular components is not constant but varies with the  viewing angle. In order to keep the resulting formulae simple, several approximations are made, which are quite  accurate but allow for tabulation, fast calculation and even for accurate importance sampling.  1. },

  abstract = {The resolution of some problems of electromagnetic scattering from
random rough surfaces implies the derivation of the illumination
function, especially when the geometrical optics approximation is valid.
In current models, the shadowing effects occurring for both the
transmitter and the receiver are assumed to be independent of their
azimuthal directions. This assumption makes it possible to compute
separately the shadowing probabilities in each direction. However, if
the transmitter and receiver azimuthal directions are close, these
probabilities become strongly correlated. In such a configuration, the
uncorrelation approximation induces an overestimation of the average
illumination function up to ? as well as a discontinuity. In this paper,
assuming surfaces of isotropic Gaussian statistics with independent
heights and slopes, this correlation is taken into account. Comparisons
of our model with Monte Carlo simulations are made and show a very good
agreement, which validates our approach.

applied to study the backscattering enhancement phenomenon, which
appears when the surface rms slope is greater than 0.5. The formulation
is reduced to the geometric optics approximation in which the
second-order illumination function is taken into account. This study is
developed for a two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic stationary rough
dielectric surface and for any surface slope and height distributions
assumed to be statistically even. Using the Weyl representation of the
Green function (which introduces an absolute value over the surface
elevation in the phase term), the incoherent scattering coefficient
under the stationary phase assumption is expressed as the sum of three
terms. The incoherent scattering coefficient then requires the numerical
computation of a ten- dimensional integral. To reduce the number of
numerical integrations, the geometric optics approximation is applied,
which assumes that the correlation between two adjacent points is very
strong. The model is then proportional to two surface slope
probabilities, for which the slopes would specularly reflect the beams
in the double scattering process. In addition, the slope distributions
are related with each other by a propagating function, which accounts
for the second-order illumination function. The companion paper is
devoted to the simulation of this model and comparisons with an 'exact'
numerical method.
